"""Telegram capture relay (ADR-020).

Store-and-forward phone capture: the user shares a post URL from any app to
their private Telegram bot chat; this service polls Telegram OUTBOUND
(`getUpdates` — no webhook, no inbound port, no public URL) on an interval,
drains every pending message, and saves each URL through the exact same
pipeline as a WebUI paste (`ingest_url_core`). Telegram is the queue: with the
PC asleep, messages simply wait.

Security: messages are processed only when they come from the single locked
owner id. The lock is auto-captured from the FIRST sender after a token is
configured — anyone else is ignored (and logged). Token + owner id live in the
app-settings JSON and never cross the API (app_settings.py).

Cadence (user decision, plan instagram-telegram-capture): poll every
`telegram_poll_minutes` (default 15 — capture is not urgent), then keep an
"active window" of long-polls open for a few minutes after any activity so
collection-button taps get an instant response instead of waiting a full
interval.

Telegram's queue has one hard limit: an undelivered update is kept for **24
hours** and then dropped. Nothing recovers it afterwards (a bot cannot read chat
history), so the whole job of this service on a laptop is to be reachable at
least once a day. `kick()` exists for that: the macOS shell calls it on wake and
unlock, because macOS stops the monotonic clock during system sleep, so a lid
closed for eight hours leaves a 15 minute timer with 15 minutes still to run.
